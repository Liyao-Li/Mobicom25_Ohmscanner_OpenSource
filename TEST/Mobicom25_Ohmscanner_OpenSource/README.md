# Mobicom25_Ohmscanner_OpenSource
The artifact evaluation process aims to verify the reproducibility and applicability of the findings outlined in our paper.

Our artifact includes simulation models for the designed tag, along with data showing impedance variations across different states. Additionally, for comparison with RF-EATS, we have reproduced the RF-EATS code and accompanying data. To illustrate the workflow of OhmScanner, we also provide code for collecting raw data.

* **code:**The code is organized into three two-files, *Reproduce_RF_EASTS* and *SCRead*;
  * Reproduce_RF_EASTS : Contains our reproduction of the RF-EATS system, as described in the paper "Food and Liquid Sensing in Practical Environments Using Commercial RFID Tags.";
  * SCReadï¼šContains all the source code used for reading Sensor Codes and OCRSS values from Magnus S3 chips using the ThingMagic M6 RFID reader.
  
* **simulate model:** Contains the simulation files for the antenna design discussed in the article. All simulations were conducted using ANSYS HFSS 2018.
