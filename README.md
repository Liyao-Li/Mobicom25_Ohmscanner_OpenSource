# Mobicom25_Ohmscanner_OpenSource
The artifact evaluation process aims to verify the reproducibility and applicability of the findings outlined in our paper.

Our artifact includes simulation models for the designed tag, along with data showing impedance variations across different states. Additionally, for comparison with RF-EATS, we have reproduced the RF-EATS code and accompanying data. To illustrate the workflow of OhmScanner, we also provide code for collecting raw data.

* **code:**The code is organized into three two-files, *Reproduce_RF_EASTS* and *SCRead*
  * Reproduce_RF_EASTS : Contains our reproduction of the RF_EASTS system described in the paper Food and Liquid Sensing in Practical Environments using RFIDs;
  * SCReadï¼šContains all our codes for reading Sensor Code and OCRSS from Magnus s3 using Impinj M6 reader.

* **simulate model:** Contains the simulation files of the antenna mentioned in the article. The simulation is done using HFSS 2018.
