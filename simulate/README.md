## Description

Our core goal is to achieve impedance changes by affecting the antenna. So here are three different ways of affecting antenna impedance in our article.

* button.adet: OhmScan-Based Keystub-Equivalent Button Board used this way: change the impedance of the antenna by changing the antenna's closed loop.
* capAntenna.adet: Liquid Concentration Sensing, Pressure Sensing and Temperature Sensing used this way: change the impedance of the antenna by changing the antenna's external impedance.
* roateAntenna.adet: UV Light Sensor used this way: change the impedance of the antenna by changing the antenna's shape.
